# PakeMansFightClub
Welcome to PakeManzFightClub!! This is a simulation based on the game PokemonGO by GameFreak and Nintendo 
the names and types used are not my creation, the AI and fighting system is. This is not at all anything 
like pokemon.

in order to run this copy and paste all the files into the Python IDE of your choice and run it, or download 
all of the files and create a blank notebook file and write the following:

python main.py

that should open a command-line window which will give a proper result.
